SELECT * FROM books;


--Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address

UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';


--Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table -- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';

--Task 6: Create Summary Tables: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**


CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn

--4. Data Analysis & Findings
--The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

--Task 7. Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category:
